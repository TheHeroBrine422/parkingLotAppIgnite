# parkingLotAppIgnite

10/7/2022 Update: This repo is mostly abandoned. I was writing this as a project for my senior year of high school and I didn't finish it before I graduated. The backend is mostly finished but still needs extensive testing and documentation. The frontend mostly works with the features that are implemented, but is missing many planned features. The code is hardcoded to only work with bentonvillek12.org emails so using this project without changing it for other google accounts is impossible. I think another student might be picking it back up but I have no confirmation of that.

A app to manage the parking lot for the Ignite Building.
